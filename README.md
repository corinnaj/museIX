An interactive media project developed using Processing

### Libraries  
We are currently using the `Sound` library for sounds and `Ketai` as the Android hardware interface, both are available from inside processing.
In addition we use `SoundCipher` for sounds as well, which you can find [here](http://explodingart.com/soundcipher/).
